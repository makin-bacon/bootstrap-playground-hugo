# mytheme-hugo-bootstrap
Install Hugo ([On os x use homebrew, for PCs use Choclatey or Scoop](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/))

Install NPM [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm]

Install Github Desktop [https://desktop.github.com/]

Go [https://github.com/makin-bacon/bootstrap-playground-hugo]

Go here and clone the repo or add straight to Github Desktop using the button/s on page: [https://github.com/makin-bacon/bootstrap-playground-hugo]

Run the following commands in this order:
npm install
hugo server -D

This should work as-is but I'll improve stuff, add some scripts to assist dev etc.

Everything is SCSS but you can just use straight CSS if you like. I'll expand on the docs and make things a bit friendlier.
